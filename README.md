XCode-Custom-Behavior
=====================

Created a custom behaviour based on apple script

 Create new behavior in XCode (uncheck everything and go to Run -> script -> add the this script). 
 Make sure you save this script as text and dont open in AppleScript Editor. XCode doesnt like it
 Also you need to give +x permission to this text file.
 
 DEBUG
 Copy the script in AppleScript editor and Run from there, remote try / end try block to see errors
 if any.
 
 This script allows develoer to see what they need to see while doing coding and something that cannot
 be achieved using XCode standards behaviors. It takes you to Full Screen mode, open the project Navigator
 for you and if you are on storyboard or xib it opens File Inspector utilities
